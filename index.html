                                <p>Hi, I'm Kenneth. Growing up I was obsessed with all things computers. One of my earliest memories was playing a Batman game on my brothers Amstrad.<br><br>
                                    I started to get into coding when I was about 10. It was a scripting language in a game I played in which you could manipulate in game objects. </p>

                                <h1>My Hobbies:</h1>
                                <p>In my spare time I love to code. I am also an avid PC gamer (mainly MMO's). I also enjoy tinkering with electronics.
                                    <br><br>
                                    While not in front of a Computer I also enjoy taking walks. </p>

                                <h1>Why a developer?</h1>
                                <p>Becoming a Developer has always been something that I am immensely passionate about. The idea that you can create anything you like if you just put the time and effort in. <br><br>Being a developer is never going to be "just a job" for me. It's given me new ways to think about how to approach problems and a hobby that no matter how much you learn, there will always be ways to continually challenge yourself and improve your skills.</p>

                                <p><b>-Python 3.10:</b> I have finished the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. I have applied my knowledge of Python to my most recent project "Tweet Map" which uses Python for the Back-End. </p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>JavaScript:</b> I have completed a JavaScript Essentials course by Lawrence Turton via udemy. I have put my knowledge of JavaScript to 2 of my projects: Portfolio Website & the Front-End of Tweet Map.</p>
                                <br>
                                <p><b>-HTML5 & CSS3:</b> I have a understanding of HTML5 & CSS3. I have also made myself familiar with some of the newly supported CSS modules such as Grid & Flexbox which combined together allows for a powerful way to layout websites.</p>
                                <br>

                                <p><b>-Maven:</b> Outside of my Java Course, I learnt the basics of using the build automation tool Maven. I found that when I wanted to open up projects outside of my IDE at the time, Netbeans, there was some issues transfering projects over. I sought out to fix this so any future projects with Java would be ok and I settled on Maven.</p>
